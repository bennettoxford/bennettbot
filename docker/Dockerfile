# Ok, we've built everything we need, build an image with all dependencies but
# no code.
#
# Not including the code at this stage has two benefits:
#
# 1) this image only rebuilds when the handlful of files needed to build bennettbot-base
#    changes. If we do `COPY . /app` now, this will rebuild when *any* file changes.
#
# 2) Ensures we *have* to mount the volume for dev image, as there's no embedded
#    version of the code. Otherwise, we could end up accidentally using the
#    version of the code included when the prod image was built.
